      <description>My name is Sean Simmons and I am currently a Senior Computational Biologist over at the Broad Institute in Joshua Levin&amp;rsquo;s group in the Stanley Center. I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with single cell and single nucleus data since before it was cool&amp;ndash;way back in 2016, when a few hundred cells was a big deal! I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on a lot of projects at the corner of RNA-seq (usually single nuclei or single cell, but sometmes spatial or bulk as well) and neuroscience (with a particular focus on neuropsychiatric disorders).</description>
