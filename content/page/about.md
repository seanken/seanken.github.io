My name is Sean Simmons and I am currently a Senior Computational Biologist over at the Broad Institute in Joshua Levin's group in the Stanley Center. I've been working with single cell and single nucleus data since before it was cool--way back in 2016, when a few hundred cells was a big deal! I've worked on a lot of projects at the corner of RNA-seq (usually single nuclei or single cell, but sometmes spatial or bulk as well) and neuroscience (with a particular focus on neuropsychiatric disorders). Before that I was a grad student over at MIT (followed by a brief post doc at MIT/SFU) where I studied genomic privacy and methods to help preserve it.
