## Is that what the data really says?
I am a computational scientist (and reformed mathematician), looking to share some of the cool stuff I find I think might be useful to other computional biologists (the type of stuff that never seems to make it into publications!). Will be mostly single cell/nuclei data analysis, but hoping to share some other cool stuff as well!
